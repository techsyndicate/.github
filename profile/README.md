### ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Weâ€™re Tech Syndicate,

the computer club at [Amity International School, Sector 46, Gurgaon](https://www.amity.edu/ais/gurgaon46/).

---

Weâ€™re a family of super-passionate developers, designers, programmers, filmmakers, quizzers, and artists who strive for success in their fields. Our clubâ€™s goal is to cultivate an ardent community at school and foster learning novel technologies to build for good.

We participate in technology symposiums all round the year and have won accolades at regional, national, as well as international stages. Some of the repositories on this GitHub org are our best submissions for high school events in and around New Delhi.

Since 2016, weâ€™ve also been hosting Robotronics, our flagship umbrella event that receives participation from 500+ students across India. Open to all, Robotronics houses competitions in over 11 events, proving to be an exciting blend of ingenuity, logic, and exuberance. Learn more about it on [our website](https://techsyndicate.club).

At school, we organize summer bootcamps, club meetings, and inTech, our annual contest aimed specifically at students in grades 6 to 11. If youâ€™re a beginner, you can check out [some resources](https://techsyndicate.club/learn) prepared by us that may help you get started in whatever youâ€™re interested in.
